## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about the use of flexbox, and how it works. 

### Continued development

I definitely need to practice positioning, the CSS box model and how to style images more. I struggled a bit with perfectly aligning the image and the div (.info), and I dont know how to do this.
